# AD-CLICKS-ANALYSIS-WITH-R
This repository contains a notebook with R code that I used to analyze who is most likely to click on an ad related to a cryptography course.

## Description
My hypothetical client has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process
My main task was to analyze who is most likely to click on an ad related to a cryptography course based
on certain factors including gender, time spent on the blog site, daily internet usage, , age, country among others.
My conclusions and recommendations made from the analysis can be fount at the end of the notebook.

## Experimental design

- Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question
- Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset
- Perform univariate and bivariate data analysis
- Provide conclusions and recommendations from my insights
